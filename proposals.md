# List of Talk Proposals

This page lists talk proposals. Do you have an idea you'd like to see talked about? This is the right place for it. Just submit a [pull reguest](https://github.com/lang-talk/meetups/pulls).

If you want to give a talk some time in the future you can also add the topic here.
Don't forget to mark it as `🔧 in works` to make sure that others understand that you will take care of the talk.
This way you can create some traction for your talk before it is ready to be given.

If you'd want to propose a topic that someone else might pick up and make, mark it as `free to claim`.

The list:

- Introduction to Qualified Types `🔧 in works`
- Symbolic Execution, is it even useful? `🔧 in works`
- Continuations, how to have made a different sandwich `🔧 in works`
- Properly 🅱️ased testing `🔧 in the works`
