# List of Talk Proposals

This page lists talk proposals. Do you have an idea you'd like to see talked about? This is the right place for it. Just submit a pull reguest.

If you want to give a talk some time in the future you can also add the topic here.
Don't forget to mark it as `in works` to make sure that others understand that you will take care of the talk.
This way you can create some traction for your talk before it is ready to be given.

The list:
